# General Explanations

In this task, we need to implement a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for our application.

## Create

To create a new item, we will provide a form where the user can enter the necessary details and submit the form. Upon submission, the data will be sent to the server and stored in the database.

## Read

To read the existing items, we will display a list or a table that shows all the items currently stored in the database. The user can view the details of each item by clicking on it.

## Update

To update an existing item, we will provide an edit form where the user can modify the details of the item. Upon submission, the updated data will be sent to the server and stored in the database.

## Delete

To delete an existing item, we will provide a delete button or an option to remove the item from the list. When the user confirms the deletion, the item will be removed from the database.

By implementing these CRUD operations, we can provide a complete and user-friendly interface for managing the data in our application.
